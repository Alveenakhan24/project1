    <h1>CANOE SLALOM</h1>
    <h1>History of Canoe Slalom</h1>
    <div>
        <h2>What is Canoe Slalom?</h2>
        <p>Canoe slalom sees competitors navigate a whitewater course - up to 300 metres in length - by passing through
            a maximum 25 upstream and downstream gates in as quick a time as possible.

            There are two types of boats: canoes, where the athlete is strapped into the boat in a kneeling position
            using a single-blade paddle, and kayaks with the athletes seated and employing a double-bladed paddle.

            New for Paris 2024 is extreme kayak where, instead of the usual individual challenge against the clock, four
            athletes race against each other on a shortened course.</p>
        <h3>By whom, where and when was Canoe Slalom invented?</h3>
        <p>Canoe slalom was founded in Switzerland in the early 1930s as a summer alternative to slalom skiing although
            initial races were on flatwater rather than whitewater courses.</p>
        <h3>What are the rules of Canoe Slalom?</h3>
        <p>In the traditional time challenge, courses are designed so leading athletes will complete them in between 90
            and 110 seconds. The time penalty for touching a gate is two seconds, while missing a gate incurs a hefty
            50-second sanction.

            In extreme kayak, also known as kayak cross, the four competitors slide off a start ramp more than two
            metres above the water and from there it's a race to the first buoy and almost anything goes. Contact with
            gates and other boats is permitted although missing a gate - or not performing a kayak roll somewhere on the
            course - results in disqualification.</p>
        <h2>Canoe Slalom and the Olympics</h2>
        <p>Canoe slalom was first included as a medal event at the 1972 Munich Games and was not seen at the Olympic
            Games again until Barcelona 1992.

            Up until Rio 2016 there were four events: men's C-1 canoe, K-1 kayak and C-2 canoe (men's pair), and women's
            K-1 kayak. At Tokyo 2020, the men's C-2 was replaced by the first Olympic women's C-1 competition.

            The addition of the inaugural extreme kayak races - shortened to X-1 - swells the number of events to six.

        <h2>Best Slalom Canoeists to watch</h2>
        <p>Australia's Jessica Fox, the daughter of former world champions Richard Fox and Myriam Fox-Jerusalmi, finally
            won her first Olympic title in C-1 after numerous world titles. She also won K-1 bronze at Tokyo 2020 to add
            to previous medals at London 2012 and Rio 2016. The French-born canoeist is also the reigning kayak cross
            world champion.

            On the men's side, athletes from central Europe - especially Czechia and Slovakia - have dominated. Jiri
            Prskavec is the reigning Olympic K-1 champion with fellow Czech Vit Prindis holding the world crown.
            Germany's Sideris Tasiadis is the reigning C1 world champion and a two-time Olympic medallist, taking bronze
            behind Slovenia's Benjamin Savsek at Tokyo 2020.</p>
        <h2>Canoe Slalom Competition Rules at Paris 2024</h2>
        <p>In canoe and kayak slalom, there are initial preliminary heats with each athlete having two runs. Only the
            best run counts with either 15 or 20 progressing to the semi-final.

            There is just one run in the semi-final with the best 10 times going through to the final where the best
            times will decide gold, silver and bronze.

            In extreme kayak, there will be an initial time trial with to determine seedings in the 32-strong knockout
            phase. There are eight heats containing four athletes with the top two in each going through to the
            quarter-finals.

            The top two in the quarter-finals will progress to the semi-finals, and then the top two again will go
            through to the final where the medals are decided.</p>
