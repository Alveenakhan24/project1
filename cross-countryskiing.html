    <h1>CROSS-COUNTRY SKIING</h1>
    <h1>History of Cross-Country Skiing</h1>
    <div>
        <p>Cross-country skiing is the oldest type of skiing. It emerged from a need to travel over snow-covered terrain
            and developed as a sport at the end of the 19th century.</p>
        <h3>Norwegian Origins</h3>
        <p>For centuries in the snow-covered North, skis were required to chase game and gather firewood in winter time.
            With long distances between the small, isolated communities and hard, snowy winters, skiing also became
            important as means of keeping in social contact. The word “ski” is a Norwegian word which comes from the Old
            Norse word “skid”, a split length of wood.</p>
        <h3>Earliest Form</h3>
        <p>Different types of skis emerged at various regions at about the same time. One type had a horizontal
            toe-piece binding. The modern ski bindings are based on the Fennoscandian model of the 19th century. The
            East-Siberian type was a thin board with a vertical four-hole binding. Sometimes it was covered with fur.
            The Lapps used a horizontal stem-hole binding. Present-day cross-country skis were developed from the type
            used by the Lapps.</p>
        <h3>First Competition</h3>
        <p>Norwegian army units were skiing for sport (and prizes) in the 18th century. Skiing for sport appeared in
            Norway in the mid-19th century; the first race on record is 1842.The famous Holmenkollen ski festival
            started in 1892, with the focus initially on the Nordic combined event. However, in 1901, a separate
            cross-country race was added to the festival.</p>
        <h3>Scandinavian Dominance</h3>
        <p>The men’s event debuted at the first Winter Olympic Games in Chamonix in 1924, and the women’s event debuted
            at the 1952 Oslo Games. The sport has traditionally been dominated by the Nordic countries.</p>
